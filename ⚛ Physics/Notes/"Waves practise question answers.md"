1) 
	Two properties that do not change across the EM spectrum are velocity and amplitude.

2) 
	a) 
		i) Red diffracts the most, green in the middle and violet the least
		ii) No diffraction has taken place in any of the rays. Therefore, all three wavelengths travel together resulting in white area.
			iii) d * sin((theta)) = n * (lambda)

			(1.67e+6 * sin(19.1)) / 1 = 5.464e+7

	b)  hc / 4.36e+6 = 4.6e-19J

3) 
	i) Infrared radition is electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency.

	ii) v = (lambda) * f
	f = 3e+8 / 6.7e13 = 4.48e-6Hz
